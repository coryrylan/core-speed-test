<p>Small experimental speed test tool using JavaScript<p>

<p> This is a small side project I am working on. It is a speed test tool to test my server response on any signal/device.
I would like to experiment with how to get the most accurate result possible using only JavaScript.
There are many factors that contribute to connection speed. This should not be used to decide critical 
application decisions. Also to note this gives a estimate speed based on the connection to server it is hosted on. Depending on 
where the code is hosted will effect the results.</p>

<p>Please feel free to offer sugestions or contribute. </p>
