<p>Small experimental speed test tool using JavaScript<p>

<p> This is a small side project I am working on. It is a speed test tool to test my server response on any signal/device.
I would like to experiment with how to get the most accurate result possible using only JavaScript. 
Please feel free to offer sugestions or contribute. </p>
